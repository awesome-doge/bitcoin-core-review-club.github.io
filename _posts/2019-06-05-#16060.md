[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16060](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16060)

## Notes

- Softforks have used a variety of deployment methods in the past:
  - flag day
  ([BIP 30](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0030.mediawiki))
  - on-chain co-ordination ([BIP
16](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki))
  - 'IsSuperMajority' ([BIP
34](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki), [BIP
66](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki) and [BIP
65](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki))
  - 'Version Bits'/'BIP9' (CSV - [BIP
68](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki), [BIP
112](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki) and [BIP
113](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki), and
segwit - [BIP
141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki), [BIP
143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki) and [BIP
144](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0144.mediawiki)).
- After a soft fork is activated and some time has passed, the exact activation
  method is no longer interesting. For example, we don't care whether segwit
was activated by BIP9, BIP91 or UASF. What we know is that the majority of
economic nodes started enforcing the segwit rules from block 481824.
- The ISM soft fork heights were hard-coded in [Bitcoin Core PR
  #8391](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8391), and documented in [BIP
90](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0090.mediawiki). Depending
on your definition, this could be considered a 'hard fork' since a previously
invalid chain becomes valid. However, for such a chain to be the most-work
chain would involve a multi-year reorg, so such a definition is not very
useful.
- P2SH and segwit script validation was enforced back to genesis (with one
  exception) in [Bitcoin Core PR
#11739](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11739).
- This PR attempts to hard-code the heights of CSV and segwit activation.
- It also changes the format of soft fork reporting in the return object of
  `getblockchaininfo`.
- Review/test of this PR should include verifying that the hard-coded
  activation heights are correct.
